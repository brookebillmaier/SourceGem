## Technologies Used: 
* Ruby on Rails
* React
* React Bootstrap
* PostgreSQL
* Sass

## Approach Taken: 
I wanted to create a Dev shop/Marketing business app. I focused a majority of the time teaching myself React Bootstrap and wanted the page to look uniform. In the future, I would like to implement it so clients could control their website and make updates directly from the app. 

## Future Optimizations:
Very soon in the future I would like to add authorization so only one user is able to delete/update clients and make the entire website production level overall. I will also be implementing a modal for the services offered.
